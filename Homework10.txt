Homework 10

1. PDOs (PHP Data Objects) are a PHP extension that provides a lightweight, consistent interface for accessing databases. 
A DSN (Data Source Name) is a string that specifies the database connection details, including the database type, host, port, username,
password, and database name.

2. Environment files (.env) store sensitive configuration settings, such as database credentials and API keys, separately from 
the application code. This enhances security and facilitates environment-specific configurations. Gitignore files (.gitignore) 
specify files or directories to exclude from version control, ensuring sensitive data and temporary files aren't committed to GitHub.

3. Uploading passwords or sensitive data to GitHub should not be done. Publicly exposing credentials can compromise security. 
Instead, we can use environment variables or secure storage solutions.

4. SQL injection occurs when malicious SQL code is injected into web applications, potentially allowing attackers to access or 
manipulate sensitive data. This vulnerability arises when user input isn't properly sanitized or validated. To mitigate SQL injection, 
we can use prepared statements, and input validation. PDOs provide built-in protection mechanisms, such as prepared 
statements, to help prevent SQL injection attacks.
